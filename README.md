## 📦 Installation

### 🔹 Install All Requirements

Use the `requirements.txt` file:
 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

▶️ Run the App Locally
streamlit run app.py

🌍 Run in Google Colab (via Ngrok)
Colab doesn’t allow direct browser access to Streamlit apps, so we use ngrok:

🔸 Step-by-step:

# Install requirements
!pip install -r requirements.txt
!pip install pyngrok

🔸 Run Streamlit via Ngrok
from pyngrok import ngrok
import subprocess, time
# Kill previous tunnels
ngrok.kill()
# Start the app
process = subprocess.Popen(["streamlit", "run", "app.py"])
time.sleep(5)
# Create public URL
print("🌍 Public URL:", ngrok.connect(8501))
