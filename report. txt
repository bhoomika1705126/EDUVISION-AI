EduVision AI: Multimodal AI Classroom Assistant

Team: ML Crew

Al-Powered Interactive Learning Assistant for Classrooms

Objective: Build a Multimodal Al assistant for classrooms to dynamically answer queries using text, voice, and visuals 
while improving student engagement with personalized responses.

1. Introduction
Modern classrooms require interactive tools that can keep students engaged and support individual learning needs. 
EduVision AI is a real-time AI-powered interactive assistant designed to address this by combining text, voice, visual 
inputs, and emotion recognition to enhance classroom participation and understanding.
EduVision aligns with Intel's AI strategy by using OpenVINO for optimized model inference, ensuring low-latency 
responses on Intel hardware. It supports accessibility, engagement, and inclusive learning.

2. System Design
Architecture Overview:
EduVision AI integrates text, voice, image, and PDF inputs via a Streamlit interface, processes them through optimized 
NLP and vision pipelines, and delivers personalized output using OpenVINO.
Key Components:
- Voice input with SpeechRecognition
- PDF processing using pdfplumber
- Emotion detection via DeepFace (image-based)
- DistilBERT QA model optimized with OpenVINO
- Multilingual translation using deep-translator
- Summarization and study tips generation via NLP

3. Implementation
Technologies Used:
- Backend/Inference: OpenVINO, HuggingFace, ONNX
-NLP: Transformers, DistilBERT, deep-translator
- Visuals: DeepFace, PIL, OpenCV
- UI: Streamlit
- Voice: SpeechRecognition
- PDF: pdfplumber
- Deployment: Streamlit Cloud, Ngrok

**Deployment via Ngrok and Google Colab**
Google Colab does not support hosting web servers or exposing local ports by default. To make theStreamlit app accessible over the internet from Colab, EduVision uses ngrok â€” a secure tunnelingtool.
Why ngrok?
- It creates a public URL (e.g., https://xyz123.ngrok.io) to access the local Streamlit app running onport 8501.
- It allows app demos, testing, and remote access without complex deployments.
Steps:
1. Start the Streamlit app in the background.
2. Use ngrok to tunnel the local port.
3. Display the public URL for user access.

Intel Optimization:
- Converted DistilBERT to OpenVINO IR using optimum.intel
- Used OVModelForQuestionAnswering for low-latency inference on Intel CPU- Enables fast, efficient deployment on AI 
PC with Intel hardware

4. Conclusions
EduVision AI proves that a multimodal classroom assistant can:
- Answer diverse student questions in real time
- Monitor student engagement via emotion detection
- Support inclusive learning with multilingual and multimodal input

It aligns with Intel's goals for real-time, edge-deployable AI. OpenVINO boosts its performance on Intel CPUs, making it 
practical for everyday use in classrooms. Future enhancements include video-based emotion monitoring, quiz generation, 
and teacher dashboards.
